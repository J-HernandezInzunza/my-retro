# Objective 

Help me define a plan and UI layout to create an in-house tool for my teams retrospectives. Ask me clarifying questions along the way as we refine this. Lets track our discussions in a file so we can always reference it and not lose context.

## UI

I can think of a few views I need, but feel free to suggest others. Reference attached image for some guidance here, my layout should be somewhat similar.

1. A view to have the use identify themselves, this can be session based. Login and auth should be kept out of scope for now.
2. The main retro dashboard, comprised of 4 columns, What went well?, What didnâ€™t go well?, What have I learned?, What still puzzles me?
   1. These columns should contain cards which hold the retro item with the author of the note and a button or a way for other participants to upvote the item to increase its importance and relevance to the meeting.
   2. In this same view we should also have a modal that allows users to add retro items, each column should have an add button to do this. But the added cards should be able to be dragged around into other columns
   3. All columns are visible on screen at once
