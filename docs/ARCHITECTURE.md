# True Vertical Slice Architecture for Retrospective Tool

## What is True Vertical Slice Architecture?

A **true vertical slice** contains everything needed to deliver a complete user capability from UI to database. Each slice should be:

1. **Independently deployable** - Can work without other slices
2. **End-to-end complete** - Contains all layers (UI, business logic, data)
3. **User-centric** - Organized around user capabilities, not technical concerns
4. **Minimally coupled** - Shares as little as possible with other slices

## Core Insight: Retrospectives Beyond Columns

Future retrospectives might not follow column patterns at all. Consider these formats:

- **Timeline retrospectives** (events on a timeline)
- **Mood board retrospectives** (visual/image-based)
- **Voting-only retrospectives** (just vote on pre-defined topics)
- **Free-form retrospectives** (canvas-style with sticky notes anywhere)
- **Structured questionnaires** (form-based with specific questions)

This requires a **completely flexible data model** and **format-agnostic architecture**.

## Implementation and Examples

For detailed implementation examples, including the complete frontend and backend directory structures and code patterns, please see the **[Vertical Slice Architecture Implementation Guide](./vertical-slice-architecture.md)**.

That document serves as the "how-to" guide for developers building new features and represents the ideal state of a feature slice.
